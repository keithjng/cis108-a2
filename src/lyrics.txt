How lucky am I
How lucky am I yeah
To love somebody to love somebody
How lucky am I
How lucky am I yeah
To love somebody to love somebody like
You are the voice in my head something I cannot forget
Your word is gospel and I want you
Moving at the speed of light two wrongs can still make a right
If you believe it and I want to
How lucky am I
How lucky am I yeah
To love somebody to love somebody
How lucky am I
How lucky am I yeah
To love somebody to love somebody like
Sometimes I wish you wouldve stayed in my dreams
Cause now that youre real now I could lose you
Nothing lasts forever aint as bad as it seems
Cause my favorite thing to do is to do nothing with you
How lucky am I
How lucky am I yeah
To love somebody to love somebody
How lucky am I

To love somebody to love somebody like
To love somebody to love somebody

Its not every day you could hear me say you could hear me
I love somebody I love somebody yeah
